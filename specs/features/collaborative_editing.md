# Feature: Collaborative Spec Editing

## Objective

Enable multiple users to edit the same specification in real time, with role-based permissions and version tracking.

## Background

Currently, all specs are edited individually. This feature introduces shared access, which supports concurrent workflows among team members and lays the foundation for commenting and version control.

## Requirements

- Users with `contributor`, `admin`, or `owner` permissions can edit the specification content.
- Edits are auto-saved every 10 seconds or when the user pauses for 2 seconds.
- All edits should be logged with timestamp and user ID.
- Previous versions can be viewed and restored.
- Only one user can edit a given paragraph at a time to avoid conflicts.
- Users with `viewer` permission cannot make any changes but can see real-time updates.

## Roles & Permissions

| Role        | Can View | Can Edit | Can Restore Versions |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| viewer      | ✅        | ❌        | ❌                    |
| contributor | ✅        | ✅        | ❌                    |
| admin       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅                    |
| owner       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅                    |

## UX Flow

1. User opens a shared spec.
2. If they have edit access, they can place the cursor and begin typing.
3. A visual indicator shows who is editing each paragraph.
4. Users can click “Version History” to view or restore past versions.

## Edge Cases

- What happens if two users attempt to edit the same paragraph at once?
  - The second user sees a lock indicator and must wait or request control.
- What if a user loses connection mid-edit?
  - Draft changes are saved locally and synced when reconnected.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Inline comments and discussion threads
- Offline collaborative editing
