# Feature: Project Creation

## Objective

Enable users to create a new project workspace and initialize it with starter specification templates.

## Requirements

- User must be logged in to create a project.
- User can create a new project from the dashboard or project list view.
- Project must have:
  - Title (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Visibility setting (default: private)
- After creation, the system:
  - Assigns the current user as project owner
  - Initializes an empty folder for the project
  - Optionally creates starter specs (e.g., feature.md, test.md, ux.md)
- Redirects user to the new project's workspace upon successful creation

## UX Flow

1. User clicks “New Project” from the dashboard.
2. A modal/form appears prompting for:
   - Project title
   - Description (optional)
   - Visibility (private/public toggle)
3. User clicks “Create Project”
4. System validates and submits form
5. On success:
   - Project is created and associated with user
   - Starter specs are scaffolded in `/specs/[project-name]/`
   - User is redirected to the project’s spec dashboard

## Edge Cases

- Duplicate project title: show an error or auto-increment (e.g., “My Project (2)”)
- User loses connection mid-creation: form draft should be recoverable from local storage
- Auth token expired: prompt user to log in again

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Team invitations during project creation
- Project templates from existing projects
- Public sharing and cloning
