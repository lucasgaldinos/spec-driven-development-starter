# Context Update Orchestrator

## Metadata

- **Type**: Tool Specification
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Active
- **Dependencies**: All context generation tools, Process execution system

## Objective

Orchestrate the execution of all context generation tools in a coordinated workflow to ensure complete and consistent AI assistant context synchronization after specification changes.

## Context

Maintaining synchronized context across multiple generated artifacts requires coordinated execution of several specialized tools. This orchestrator ensures all context files are updated consistently and provides a single command interface for complete context refresh operations.

### Workflow Orchestration
- [ ] Execute all context generation tools in proper dependency order
- [ ] Coordinate input/output dependencies between tools

### Tool Integration
- [ ] Specification context extraction
- [ ] Quick reference documentation generation
- [ ] Copilot instructions compilation
- [ ] TODO list generation from specifications
- [ ] Any additional context tools discovered dynamically

### Progress Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time progress reporting for each tool execution
- [ ] Consolidated status display with visual indicators

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Continue execution if non-critical tools fail
- [ ] Rollback capabilities for failed operations
- [ ] Detailed error reporting with remediation guidance
- [ ] Partial completion status tracking
- [ ] Recovery options for interrupted operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] Complete typical workflow in under 60 seconds
- [ ] Parallel execution where dependencies allow
- [ ] Efficient resource utilization across tool executions
- [ ] Progress feedback within 2 seconds of start

- [ ] Maintain consistency across all generated artifacts
- [ ] Verify output integrity before completion
- [ ] Provide detailed diagnostic information for failures

### Usability
- [ ] Single command execution with sensible defaults
- [ ] Clear progress indicators and status messages
- [ ] Comprehensive help and usage information
- [ ] Integration with development environment workflows

## Technical Interface

### Input Parameters
```
options: object = {}

### Tool Execution Order
```
1. Specification Extractor (no dependencies)

}

Error: {
  status: "error",
  failedTool: string,
  errorMessage: string,
  rollbackRequired: boolean
}
```

### CLI Interface
```bash
update-all-context [options]
  --specs-dir <path>     Specifications directory (default: ./specs)
  --output-dir <path>    Output directory (default: ./)
  --verbose             Enable detailed logging
  --parallel            Enable parallel execution where possible
  --fail-fast           Stop on first error
  --skip <tools>        Comma-separated list of tools to skip
  --dry-run             Show what would be executed without running
  --help                Show usage information
```

## Algorithm Specification

### Initialization Phase
1. Validate input parameters and tool availability
2. Discover available context generation tools
3. Build dependency graph for execution ordering
4. Verify prerequisites (directories, permissions, etc.)
5. Initialize progress tracking and logging systems

### Execution Phase
1. Execute tools according to dependency order
2. Monitor progress and resource utilization
3. Collect output artifacts and metadata
4. Validate generated content integrity
5. Handle errors and recovery as needed

### Completion Phase
1. Verify all expected artifacts are generated
2. Validate consistency across generated files
3. Generate execution summary and metrics
4. Clean up temporary files and resources
5. Report final status and any issues

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Non-critical failures**: Log error, continue with remaining tools
2. **Critical failures**: Stop execution, attempt rollback if possible
3. **Dependency failures**: Skip dependent tools, report impact
4. **System failures**: Immediate stop with diagnostic information

## Tool Discovery and Management

### Dynamic Tool Discovery
- [ ] Scan tools directory for executable context generators
- [ ] Read tool metadata and dependency information
- [ ] Build execution graph based on discovered tools
- [ ] Support for plugin architecture in future versions

### Tool Interface Standards
```
Each tool must provide:
- Standard CLI interface with consistent options
- Exit codes (0 = success, non-zero = error)
- JSON status output option for machine parsing
- Help/usage information
- Version information
```

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Explicit dependency declarations between tools
- [ ] Automatic ordering based on input/output relationships
- [ ] Parallel execution optimization where safe
- [ ] Circular dependency detection and prevention

## Validation and Testing

### Test Categories
- [ ] Unit tests for tool discovery and ordering logic
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflow execution
- [ ] Error simulation tests for failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for large specification sets
- [ ] Concurrency tests for parallel execution paths

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] All tools succeed (happy path)
- [ ] Individual tool failures with recovery
- [ ] Missing dependencies and prerequisites
- [ ] Interrupted execution and recovery
- [ ] Large specification sets with performance requirements

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All tools execute in proper order
- [ ] Error conditions handled appropriately
- [ ] Generated artifacts are consistent and valid
- [ ] Performance meets defined requirements
- [ ] User experience is clear and informative

## Technology Portability

### Core Algorithm (Language Agnostic)
1. **Process Orchestration**: Sequential/parallel process execution with monitoring
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Topological sorting of tool dependencies
3. **Error Aggregation**: Collection and reporting of multi-process errors
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status monitoring across processes

### Platform Considerations
- [ ] Process execution and monitoring (cross-platform)
- [ ] File system operations and atomic updates
- [ ] Signal handling for graceful interruption
- [ ] Resource monitoring and limits

### Language Implementation Notes
- **Node.js**: Use child_process with async/await and streams
- **Python**: Use subprocess module with asyncio for concurrent execution
- **Go**: Use os/exec package with goroutines for parallel processing
- **Rust**: Use std::process with async/await and tokio runtime
- **Java**: Use ProcessBuilder with CompletableFuture for async execution

- [ ] VS Code task integration
- [ ] Git hooks compatibility (pre-commit, post-merge)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration with proper exit codes

### Configuration Management

- [ ] Environment variable support
- [ ] User preference persistence
- [ ] Workspace-specific settings

### Monitoring and Observability
