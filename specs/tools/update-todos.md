- **Status**: Active
- **Dependencies**: Specifications analysis, Source code analysis

## Objective

Automatically analyze specifications and codebase to generate comprehensive, prioritized task lists that guide development work by identifying missing implementations, incomplete specifications, technical debt, and required improvements.

## Context
