# Specification Context Extractor

## Metadata

- **Type**: Tool Specification
- **Priority**: High  
- **Status**: Active
- **Dependencies**: File system access, Specification documents

## Objective

Extract and aggregate all specification content into a consolidated context file that can be used by AI coding assistants (particularly GitHub Copilot) to understand the complete project context.

## Context

AI coding assistants work most effectively when they have comprehensive context about the project's specifications, architecture, and requirements. This tool automatically discovers and aggregates all specification documents into a single context file that can be easily consumed by AI systems.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Processing
- [ ] Discover all specification files in the specifications directory tree
- [ ] Read and parse markdown specification documents  
- [ ] Aggregate content from multiple specification categories
- [ ] Generate consolidated output in JavaScript comment format for maximum AI compatibility
- [ ] Include metadata about generation time and source files

### Content Categories
- [ ] Product intent and overview documents
- [ ] Architecture and technical specifications
- [ ] Feature specifications from features directory
- [ ] Test specifications from tests directory
- [ ] Any additional specification categories discovered dynamically

### File Discovery
- [ ] Recursively scan specifications directory
- [ ] Filter for markdown files (.md extension)
- [ ] Handle missing or empty directories gracefully
- [ ] Maintain consistent ordering for reproducible output

### Output Generation
- [ ] Generate JavaScript comment block format
- [ ] Include clear section headers for each specification category
- [ ] Preserve original markdown formatting within comments
- [ ] Add generation timestamp and metadata
- [ ] Write to configurable output file location

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] Process typical specification sets (< 100 files) in under 5 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage proportional to total specification content size
- [ ] Efficient file system operations with minimal I/O overhead

### Reliability
- [ ] Handle malformed or corrupted specification files gracefully
- [ ] Continue processing if individual files are inaccessible
- [ ] Atomic file writes to prevent partial output states
- [ ] Clear error reporting for troubleshooting

### Maintainability
- [ ] Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Extensible architecture for new specification types
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
- [ ] Logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring

## Technical Interface

### Input Parameters
```
specsDirectory: string = "./specs"
  - Root directory containing all specification files
  - Should support both relative and absolute paths
  - Default to standard specifications directory

outputPath: string = "./context-for-copilot.js"  
  - Target file path for generated context
  - Should support both relative and absolute paths
  - Parent directories created automatically if needed

options: object = {}
  - includeTimestamp: boolean = true
  - verboseLogging: boolean = false
  - fileExtensions: string[] = [".md"]
  - excludePatterns: string[] = []
```

### Output Format
```javascript
// SPECIFICATION CONTEXT FOR GITHUB COPILOT
// Generated: [ISO 8601 timestamp]

/*
PRODUCT INTENT:
[Content from product-intent.md]

ARCHITECTURE:
[Content from architecture.md]

FEATURES:
--- FEATURE-NAME ---
[Content from feature specification]

TESTS:
--- TEST-NAME ---
[Content from test specification]
*/
```

### Return Values
```
Success: {
  status: "success",
  filesProcessed: number,
  outputSize: number,
  generationTime: number
}

Error: {
  status: "error", 
  message: string,
  failedFiles: string[],
  partialOutput: boolean
}
```

### CLI Interface
```bash
extract-context [options]
  --specs-dir <path>     Specifications directory (default: ./specs)
  --output <path>        Output file path (default: ./context-for-copilot.js)
  --include-timestamp    Include generation timestamp (default: true)
  --verbose             Enable detailed logging
  --help                Show usage information
```

## Algorithm Specification

### Discovery Phase
1. Validate input parameters and paths
2. Recursively scan specifications directory
3. Filter files by extension and exclude patterns
4. Sort files for consistent processing order
5. Collect metadata about discovered files

### Processing Phase
1. Read and validate each specification file
2. Extract content while preserving formatting
3. Categorize content by directory structure and file names
4. Handle encoding and special characters appropriately
5. Collect processing statistics and errors

### Generation Phase  
1. Generate formatted output header with metadata
2. Organize content by logical categories
3. Apply consistent formatting and indentation
4. Add section separators and navigation aids
5. Write complete output atomically to target file

### Error Recovery
1. Continue processing if individual files fail
2. Include partial results with clear error indicators
3. Generate diagnostic information for failed operations
4. Ensure output file is valid even with processing errors

## Validation and Testing

### Test Categories
- [ ] Unit tests for file discovery logic
- [ ] Unit tests for content processing and formatting
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflow
- [ ] Error handling tests for edge cases
- [ ] Performance tests for large specification sets

### Test Data Requirements
- [ ] Sample specification directories with various structures
- [ ] Malformed files for error handling validation
- [ ] Large specification sets for performance testing
- [ ] Edge cases: empty files, binary files, permission issues

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All specifications discovered and processed correctly
- [ ] Output format valid and consistent
- [ ] Error conditions handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets defined requirements
- [ ] Compatible with existing AI assistant workflows

## Technology Portability

### Core Algorithm (Language Agnostic)
1. **Directory Traversal**: Recursive file system scanning with filtering
2. **Content Aggregation**: Text file reading and concatenation with formatting
3. **Template Generation**: String interpolation with structured formatting
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with diagnostic reporting

### Platform Considerations
- [ ] File path handling (Windows/Unix compatibility)
- [ ] Character encoding support (UTF-8 primary)  
- [ ] File permission and access control handling
- [ ] Memory management for large content sets

### Language Implementation Notes
- **Node.js**: Use fs module with async/await or promises
- **Python**: Use pathlib and standard file operations
- **Go**: Use filepath and os packages with error handling
- **Rust**: Use std::fs with Result types for error handling
- **Java**: Use nio.file packages with exception handling

## Integration Requirements

### Build System Integration
- [ ] npm script compatibility
- [ ] Exit code standards (0 = success, non-zero = error)
- [ ] Standard output/error stream usage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline compatibility

### File System Requirements
- [ ] Respect gitignore patterns for output files
- [ ] Handle concurrent access to output files
- [ ] Temporary file cleanup on interruption
- [ ] Backup existing output before overwriting

### Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Structured logging with configurable levels
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Error rate and failure mode tracking
- [ ] Integration with project health monitoring
