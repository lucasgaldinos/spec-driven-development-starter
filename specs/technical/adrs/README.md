# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records for the Spec-Driven Development Starter project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide a historical record of the system's evolution.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:
- **Title**: A clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: The circumstances that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-technology-stack-selection.md) | Technology Stack Selection | Accepted | 2024-07-25 |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-real-time-collaboration-approach.md) | Real-time Collaboration Approach | Accepted | 2024-07-25 |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-database-schema-design.md) | Database Schema Design | Accepted | 2024-07-25 |
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-authentication-strategy.md) | Authentication Strategy | Accepted | 2024-07-25 |

## ADR Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Technology choices (frameworks, databases, tools)
- Architecture patterns and approaches
- Integration strategies
- Security implementations
- Performance and scalability approaches
- Breaking changes to existing architecture

### ADR Workflow

1. **Identify** the need for an architectural decision
2. **Research** alternatives and gather context
3. **Draft** the ADR with the proposed decision
4. **Review** with the team and stakeholders
5. **Accept** or revise based on feedback
6. **Update** the ADR index and relevant documentation

### ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Under discussion and review
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Contributing to ADRs

### Creating a New ADR

1. Use the next sequential number (ADR-005, ADR-006, etc.)
2. Follow the naming convention: `ADR-XXX-descriptive-title.md`
3. Use the standard ADR template (see [ADR Template](ADR-template.md))
4. Update this index file with the new ADR

### Updating Existing ADRs

- ADRs should generally not be modified once accepted
- If significant changes are needed, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Minor corrections (typos, clarifications) can be made with appropriate change tracking

### ADR Reviews

- All ADRs should be reviewed by at least two team members
- Complex or high-impact ADRs should include stakeholder review
- ADRs should be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain relevant

## ADR Templates and Tools

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local forces]

## Decision

[Describe our response to these forces, including the decision made]

## Consequences

[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision]

### Positive
[List positive outcomes]

### Negative
[List negative outcomes]

### Risks
[List potential risks]

## Alternatives Considered

[List other options that were considered and why they were rejected]

## Implementation Notes

[Any specific implementation details or requirements]

## Review Date

[When this decision should be reviewed]

---

*Decision made on: [Date]*
*Last updated: [Date]*
*Status: [Current Status]*
```

### Useful Tools

- **ADR Tools**: Command-line tools for managing ADRs
- **Markdown Linters**: Ensure consistent formatting
- **Git Hooks**: Automatic validation of ADR format

## Questions or Suggestions

If you have questions about architectural decisions or suggestions for new ADRs, please:
1. Create an issue in the project repository
2. Discuss in team meetings
3. Reach out to the technical architecture team
