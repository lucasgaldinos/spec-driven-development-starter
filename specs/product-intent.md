# Product Intent

**Spec Driven** is a collaborative specification and test design workspace for modern product teams. It provides a structured environment for capturing product intent, use cases, test cases, and architectural requirements—designed to integrate seamlessly with AI-assisted development tools such as GitHub Copilot.

## Purpose

Spec Driven aims to bridge the gap between ideation and implementation. It empowers teams to move from loosely structured ideas to machine-readable specs that fuel AI tooling and automated delivery pipelines.

## Core Values

- **Clarity First** – Encourage specification formats that are clear to both humans and machines.
- **AI Native** – Designed from the ground up to support LLM-based code generation, testing, and refactoring.
- **Collaborative by Design** – Built for teams, including role-based access and shared project contexts.
- **Composable and Extensible** – Support evolving workflows and integration with development pipelines.

## Target Users

- Product Managers and Product Owners
- Software Engineers
- Quality Assurance and Test Engineers
- UX Designers and Architects
