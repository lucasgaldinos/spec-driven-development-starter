# Security Specification

## Metadata

- **Type**: Technical / Product Overview
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Draft
- **Dependencies**: Authentication system, Database schema, API endpoints, Infrastructure

## Objective

Establish the security requirements, best practices, and implementation guidelines necessary to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance across the Spec Driven Development Platform.

## Context

The platform manages sensitive user, project, and specification data for collaborative product teams. Security is a foundational concern and must be integrated across authentication, authorization, data storage, API design, and infrastructure. Requirements are driven by OWASP recommendations, GDPR compliance, and best practices for Node.js/PostgreSQL applications.

## Security Principles

- **Least Privilege**: Users and services should have only the minimum access necessary for their roles.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (app, API, DB, infra) to mitigate risks.
- **Secure by Design**: Security requirements considered in all phases (spec, code, deployment).
- **Auditability**: All authentication and sensitive operations must be logged.
- **Compliance**: GDPR and other relevant regulatory standards adhered to.

## Requirements

### Authentication & Session Security

- JWT-based stateless authentication with refresh token rotation.
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt (minimum 12 salt rounds).
- Refresh tokens stored securely and invalidated on logout/password change.
- Rate limiting on login, registration, password reset, and token refresh endpoints.
- Session management with audit logging (IP, user agent, timestamps).
- Email verification required for new accounts and email changes.
- Password reset tokens are single-use and expire after 1 hour.

### Authorization & Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all resource endpoints (viewer, contributor, admin, owner).
- API endpoints validate user permissions before performing sensitive actions.
- Project-level permissions enforced for all CRUD operations on projects/specs.
- Admin/owner roles required for managing users and project settings.

### Data Protection

- Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens) stored only as hashes.
- All data in transit encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.
- Sensitive data (user info, refresh tokens) encrypted at rest where supported.
- No plaintext password, token, or sensitive data ever stored or logged.
- Regular database backups with access controls.

### API Security

- All protected API endpoints require valid JWT and user verification.
- Security headers set via helmet.js (Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).
- CORS configuration restricts origins in production.
- Rate limiting middleware on all sensitive endpoints.
- Standardized error handling: no internal details leaked to clients.
- Validation and sanitization of all input data.

### Infrastructure Security

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration (secrets, DB credentials).
- No secrets or sensitive data in source control.
- Docker containers use non-root users where possible.
- Automated dependency scanning for vulnerabilities.
- Monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity and errors.

### Audit & Compliance

- All authentication events (login, logout, password changes, failed attempts) logged with request IDs.
- Access and modification of sensitive data auditable by user, timestamp, and action.
- GDPR compliance: users can request data deletion (soft delete, with audit trail).
- Security incidents response plan defined.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use helmet.js for HTTP security headers.
- Implement rate limiting with middleware and per-IP/session controls.
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs; reject malformed or suspicious requests.
- Passwords are never returned in any API response.
- Use parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection.
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for CVEs.
- Use secure random token generation for all password reset and invitation flows.
- All production deployments must use HTTPS/TLS.

## Security Test Cases

- [ ] Login attempts limited per IP (5 per 15 minutes).
- [ ] Registration limited per IP/email.
- [ ] Password reset tokens expire and cannot be reused.
- [ ] Invalid/expired JWTs rejected on all protected endpoints.
- [ ] Role-based access enforced for all actions.
- [ ] Sensitive operations logged with requestId and timestamp.
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs or error responses.
- [ ] CORS restricts origins in production.
- [ ] Security headers present on all responses.

## Out of Scope

- Multi-factor authentication (2FA) for MVP (planned for future).
- SAML/SSO and external directory integration (future enterprise phase).
- Encryption of all database fields (only sensitive fields for now).
