# Architecture & Technologies Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and technology choices for the Spec-Driven Development Starter application. For detailed technical specifications, see [Technical Architecture](../technical/architecture.md).

## System Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern three-tier architecture:

```
