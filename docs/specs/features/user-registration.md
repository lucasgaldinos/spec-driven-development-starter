# User Registration Feature

## Metadata

- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Draft
- **Dependencies**: Database schema (users table), Authentication system

## Objective

Enable new users to create accounts with email verification and secure password storage.

## Context

Users need a way to register for the platform before they can create projects or collaborate on specifications. This is the entry point for all user interactions and must be secure, user-friendly, and integrated with the authentication system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] User can register with email, name, and password
- [ ] Email validation and uniqueness checking
- [ ] Password strength validation
- [ ] Email verification process
- [ ] Automatic role assignment (default: 'contributor')
- [ ] Integration with login flow
- [ ] Account activation workflow

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Password hashing using bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- [ ] Email verification within 24 hours
- [ ] Registration form validation with real-time feedback
- [ ] GDPR compliance for data collection
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent spam registrations

## API Specification

```javascript
// Registration request
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com", 
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}

// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify your account.",
    "userId": "uuid-here"
  }
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Email already exists"
}

// Email verification
GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=verification-token

// Verification success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Email verified successfully. You can now log in.",
    "user": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "contributor"
    }
  }
}
```

## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to register with my email and password so that I can access the platform
- As a new user, I want to receive email verification so that my account is secure
- As a new user, I want clear feedback if my password is too weak so that I can create a secure account
- As a new user, I want to be notified if my email is already registered so that I can try logging in instead
- As a platform owner, I want to verify email addresses so that I can ensure legitimate users

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a new user visits the registration page, when they enter valid details, then they receive a verification email
- Given a user tries to register with an existing email, when they submit the form, then they see an error message
- Given a user enters a weak password, when they type it, then they see real-time validation feedback
- Given a user clicks the verification link, when the token is valid, then their account is activated
- Given a user tries to login before verification, when they attempt login, then they're prompted to verify their email first

## Implementation Notes

- Use bcrypt for password hashing with minimum 12 salt rounds
- Generate UUID for user ID (consistent with database schema)
- Email verification tokens should expire after 24 hours
- Default role assignment: 'contributor' (can be upgraded later)
- Integration points: Login flow, password reset, user management
- Store verification tokens in database with expiration timestamps

## Test Cases

- [ ] Test case 1: Successful registration with valid data creates user and sends verification email
- [ ] Test case 2: Registration with existing email returns appropriate error
- [ ] Test case 3: Registration with weak password shows validation errors
- [ ] Test case 4: Email verification with valid token activates account
- [ ] Test case 5: Email verification with expired token shows error
- [ ] Test case 6: Multiple registration attempts are rate-limited
- [ ] Test case 7: Unverified users cannot login

## Out of Scope

- Social media login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Phone number verification
- Custom password policies per organization
- Bulk user import functionality
- Account deletion during registration process
