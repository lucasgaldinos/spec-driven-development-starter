# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for the Spec-Driven Development Starter application that supports:
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Structured specification management
- User authentication and authorization
- Future AI/LLM integration
- Rapid development and deployment

The application needs to be maintainable by a small team and scalable for future growth.

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **React 18.x with TypeScript**: Mature ecosystem, strong typing, excellent developer experience
- **Redux Toolkit**: Predictable state management for complex application state
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Socket.io-client**: Real-time communication with the backend

### Backend
- **Node.js 18.x LTS**: JavaScript everywhere, large ecosystem, good performance for I/O operations
- **Express.js**: Minimal, flexible web framework with extensive middleware ecosystem
- **Socket.io**: Real-time bi-directional communication for collaboration features
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance, JSON support, excellent performance, strong community
- **Raw SQL with pg driver**: Direct control over queries, better performance than heavy ORMs

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD integration with repository, free for public repos

## Consequences

### Positive
- Full-stack JavaScript reduces context switching for developers
- React and Node.js have large communities and extensive documentation
- PostgreSQL provides reliability and advanced features for complex queries
- Socket.io simplifies real-time features implementation
- Docker ensures consistent environments across development and production

### Negative
- JavaScript ecosystem can be volatile with frequent updates
- Single language may limit hiring pool compared to polyglot approach
- Node.js single-threaded nature may require careful handling of CPU-intensive tasks
- Raw SQL requires more careful management of database interactions

### Risks
- Dependency on npm ecosystem stability
- Potential performance bottlenecks in Node.js for CPU-intensive operations
- Database migration complexity without ORM abstractions

## Alternatives Considered

### Full-Stack Alternatives
- **Python + Django + React**: More verbose, slower development cycle
- **Java + Spring Boot + React**: Enterprise-grade but heavyweight for startup needs
- **Go + Gin + React**: Better performance but smaller ecosystem and hiring pool

### Database Alternatives
- **MongoDB**: Better for unstructured data but lacks ACID guarantees
- **Firebase**: Managed solution but vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- **SQLite**: Insufficient for multi-user real-time collaboration

### Frontend Alternatives
- **Vue.js**: Smaller ecosystem, less corporate backing
- **Svelte**: Newer technology, smaller community
- **Next.js**: Considered but full-stack React is overkill for our API needs

## Implementation Notes

- Use TypeScript across the entire stack for better type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling patterns
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code quality
- Use environment variables for configuration management
- Implement proper logging and monitoring from the start

## Review Date

This decision should be reviewed in 6 months (around Q2 2025) or when significant performance or scalability issues arise.
